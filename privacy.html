      Protecting your data is one of our top priorities.

    </p>
    <p class="policy-paragraph">
      Despite our robust security measures, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee perfect security, and you use our services at your own risk.
